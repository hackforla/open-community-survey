# Open Community Survey

Hack for LAâ€™s **Open Community Survey** project creates constructive community input environments which facilitate relationships between citizens and their government. Our surveys, design thinking workshops and other community engagement tools improve service delivery and help with the internal and external development of products that are reflective of the communities they serve and targeted towards pressing social needs.
